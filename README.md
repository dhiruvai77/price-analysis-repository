**Introduction**

Emphasizing the significance of online pricing analysis and its relevance to the retail sector. The objectives of this research includes identifying pricing patterns, understanding variations in prices across different retailers, and exploring competitive pricing strategies. PriceSpy Data was the source of data for the study and the time frame of the dataset was 2012 to early 2017.

**Methods**

**1. K-means Analysis:**
Conducted to cluster stores based on the number of products sold in each store.

**2. Descriptive Statistics**
Calculated mean, median, and standard deviation of prices for each product within and between stores and provided insights into the central tendency and variability of prices.

**3.Visualization**
Plot the relevant stores and pricedata and gained insights in pricing strategies.

**4. Hierarchial Clustering Analysis**
Utilized to identify patterns and relationships contributing to price dispersion across different price ranges over time. This helped in understanding the dynamics of price changes within and between stores.

**Results**

1. The descriptive analysis indicates that different stores exhibit varying degrees of price variability across multiple products, with some maintaining consistent pricing patterns while others demonstrate greater fluctuation in prices over time.
2. The analysis obtained by visualising prices over stores demonstrates dynamic pricing strategies among stores, with instances of predatory pricing followed by adjustments to match competitors, and a trend of price matching to maintain competitiveness over time across different products.
3. The hierarchical clustering analysis demonstrated varying pricing strategies across different stores for the selected products, with some stores exhibiting distinct pricing clusters while others shared similar pricing clusters, indicating diverse approaches to pricing within the online retail sector.

**Conclusion**

The analysis revealed diverse pricing strategies among online retailers, with strong correlations between prices across stores. Instances of predatory pricing were observed, underscoring the complexity of pricing dynamics. Understanding these dynamics is vital for retailers to remain competitive, emphasizing the need for strategic pricing optimization based on market conditions and consumer demand. Further exploration through hierarchical analysis could enhance insights into pricing clusters.
